Additional Comments:

Yes! You got the 3 boxes with the Feature text working. Awesome!

This is a little thing, but for readability, it's better to indent your <li>s, since they are children of the <ul>:
    <ul>
      <li>Schedule meetings for you</li>
      <li>Excel automation to complete your work for you</li>
      <li>Responds to emails on your behalf</li>
      <li>Does all your work for you with our revolutionary AI technology</li>
    </ul>

Overall, this looks great! You're definitely getting the hang of this stuff. Let me know if you have any questions.
